# AI-project
This project is currently at the bottom of my priority list as I am not yet sure what I want to do with it, but the current idea is a personalized chess AI that can be customized to be as good or bad as you want with ease.

If this is the implementation, it will come with a fully built application that allows the user to play chess directly in the app, see how the AI works, and also customize the UI.
